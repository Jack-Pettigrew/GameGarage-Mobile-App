# GameGarage-Mobile-App
First Android App for Mobile Computing University Project.

A University assignment designed to introduce Android Studio and the world of App development.
GameGarage is a Game information App in which users can search for numerous amounts of games through GiantBomb's database using their API. Some features implemented are purely for showcasing our ability in developing those features.
Features include:
-	Easy to use UI, making navigation relatively simple.
-	Search function, allowing for users to search for any game by title followed by a search results list.
-	A Game Profile Page to allow simple and easy delivery of game information.
-	Game Profile Image saving to local storage for user use.
-	Custom Profile Image, enabling the user to take their own picture to represent the game.
-	A Map View to show the user the GAME store to purchase the selected game.
-	A personal Favourites list sustained by an SQLite database complemented by a suitable schema.
-	Remote Storage provided by Firebase, allowing users to upload and download saved images for later use.
